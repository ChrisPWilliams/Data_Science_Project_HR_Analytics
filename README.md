# HR Analytics DA/DS Project
> NOTE: This is a Data Analytics/Science project for those who want to test their industry skills. Please upload your solutions by opening a new branch to the main. All files that are instantly merged to the main will be deleted.

## Project Brief
A large company named JWC, employs, at any given point of time, around 4000 employees. However, every year, around some of its employees leave the company, for various reasons, and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company.

Hence, the management has contracted an HR analytics firm, Xander Talent HR, to understand what JWC can do to stop minimise attrition as much as possible.

## Getting Started
The data will ideally be in a cloud database which uses some form of SQL, i.e. AWS with MySQL db, Azure with SQL Server, etc. Therefore, we will want to get the data into postgreSQL so that we can do any data gathering for our objective. To get the database set up:

1. Download the CSVs within the [Datasets](https://github.com/Stephen-Cole267/Data_Science_Project_HR_Analytics/tree/main/Datasets) folder into your directory
> Note: Keep track of where you save these CSVs as you will need to add the paths to the SQL file.
2. Create a database with pgAdmin 4 (Can calling it whatever you want)
3. Create tables within your newly created database using the [SQL](https://github.com/Stephen-Cole267/Data_Science_Project_HR_Analytics/blob/main/SQL/HR_Analytics.sql) file

> The data should now be ready for you to start the task. If you have any issues please post within the Data Analytics/Data Science Forums.

## Steps to help if you are stuck

### Requirements Gathering
The start to any project is to make sure you have clear and well-defined requirements for your project. Most projects start with a vague idea of what the stakeholder wants so as a consultant we need to get as much information out of them as possible. 

Questions to ask yourself constantly throughout the project are:
- What is the purpose of this project, why does the stakeholder want this and what is the desired outcome of the project?
- Is there any extra info that the stakeholder could tell you to help tailor the project to what they want?

Questions more specifically for Data Science:
- Are there any features that I could create to improve the model?
- What machine learning models are applicable to the project' target?
